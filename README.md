# Procedural Forest Generation

This project, developed for my computer graphics course, employs procedural generation to create a 3D forest environment. Trees are positioned randomly based on a deterministic seed, and are rendered using WebGL with .obj models. You can view the project live at [this link](https://graziele-fagundes.github.io/Procedural-Generation/).
